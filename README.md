# Team_project201

The Zero Heroes Memory Challenge project was made for the Code Fellows 201 class.

Team Members:

Rose Anne Gallus
Jay Balderas
Shiv Unadkat
Yana Radenska

The project is composed of three interlinked html pages and a solo about us html page. The three pages consist of a memory matching game, high scores for the game, and random jokes for users that don't feel like playing.

We used html, CSS, and JavaScript to build it, and it is deployed on GitHub.
